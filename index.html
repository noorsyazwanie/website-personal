<h1>My Experience During MCO</h1>
<p>Even before the recent movement control order (MCO) was enforced, 
most religious gatherings and events had been called off to prevent 
large groups of people from congregating in view Covid-19. So my experience is 
i get to learn many things during this MCO.</p>

<h2>A socially-distanced party</h2>
<p>Adhering to the MCO, a few Malaysians including me has become presumably extroverts 
and sometimes my friends and i have organised socially distancing video teleconferencing to talk 
to each other via any teleconference platforms such as via Skype or Face Time.</p>

<h2>Being a binge-watchers</h2>
Next, during this MCO, if i have nothing to or does not have any homework,
i watched a lot of movies. From Netflix to Youtube, and i finally 
have some time off to catch up on my favourite shows and movies that sometimes
i can give reviews and recommendations of movies to watch to my friends.</p>
